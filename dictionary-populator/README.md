Install the package within the virtual env. First you need to install the opal-client locally

```bash

export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib;export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include;pip install opal-python-client --compi
le --no-cache-dir -i https://registry.molgenis.org/repository/pypi-all/
```

```bash
python setup.py install --user
```

## Upgrade Opal client
Please push the new version of the opal-python-client to https://registry.molgenis.org/repository/pypi. 

Build it with:

```
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python env
source env/bin/activate

# install with wheel dist
python setup.py bdist_wheel

# upload it into the molgenis pypi registry
twine upload --repository-url https://registry.molgenis.org/repository/pypi/  dist/*
```
